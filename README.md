## Description of the Project

This console based java application is designed to allow the users to not only create their own sandwich through variety
of options but also select from pre-made signature sandwiches that it offers. Customers can choose to either 
add different toppings to their customize sandwiches or to the pre-made sandwiches from the Toppings menu. Customers can
also add sides to their order, chips and drinks. Once the user checkout, the app will display order summary and display
a receipt to the user that allows them to see their order details.
